For those of you unawear of how to play shed, it is a relativly simple game.

The first rule of shed is you may not tell anyone the rules of shed... is is why it doesn't make you play valid cards only!


So the rules to play by:

You can play multiple cards of the same value at once.
You may only play one up, down or equal to the previous card played. If you disobey a rule, you pick up the deck.


There are exceptions to this one main rule:

On a red three you may only play a two or black three.

You can play a two whenever you want and anyone can play anything on a two.

On a seven you can play anything below or equal to a seven.


Further specials:

A ten will wipe the pile of played cards, and the player who played it gets to go again.

A three will wipe itself after being played and not countered.

An eight will skip a player.

A Jack will reverse the order of play.


After anyone picks up, the next player takes the next go.


Not all the cards are dealt, the ones left need to be picked up by those who have less than three cards until they are all gone

Every player starts with three cards in hand, they need to get rid of the cards in hand to play the ones on the table, which everyone can see.

Once the ones on the table are gone, you can play your blind cards (under the tables). They are face down and you cannot see them. Once they are all gone and you have no cards in hand either, you win.

The last person to win is Shed.
